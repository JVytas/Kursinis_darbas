This is my term paper in which I review various genetic algorithms, briefly reviews their history of origin, operating principles and application possibilities for solving specific tasks. Further, a study is being conducted to solve a specific problem related to the topic: after generating a random data sequence, find the best motif by evaluating it with points and calculate how many times on average it takes to achieve this goal. In this experiment, metaparameters are changed in order to assess the impact this has on finding the desired fragment mentioned above. From the results, we can conclude that by changing metaparameters, specifically the mutation rate, we can speed up or slow down the obtaining of results.
